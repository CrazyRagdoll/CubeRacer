Hello_Planet!

My name is Sam, and this is my game, it is a simple game made by a simple man. It does not require much smarts to play. 

The aim of the game is to survive for as long as possible; the longer you live the more points you get.
There are 4 objects within the game world:
The Player - A 3D Triangular Pyramid, controlled by you!
The Enemy - Multiple 3D Cubes which will constantly move towards you when the game starts, watch out they'll kill you.
The Star - 3D Stars which will occasionally spawn, grab 'em for extra points!
The Heart - 2D Cartoon Heart, this bad boy will give you invunrability for a few seconds!

How to Play:

Here are the keys:

Function:     Key:
Move Right - Right key.
Move Left  - Left key.
Shoot      - Spacebar.
Exit       - Escape.

The libaries that I have inclucded in my games are:
SDL2 - http://www.libsdl.org/

Glew/glu - http://glew.sourceforge.net/

Vectormath - http://bullet.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bullet/trunk/Extras/vectormathlibrary/

The buildtools that I have used:

CMake - http://www.cmake.org/

When editing CMake to allow it to find different libaries I had to use external sheets of code from different website: FindSDL2.cmake, FindGLEW.cmake, FindVECTORMATH.cmake.
These websites are where I found the .cmake files:
