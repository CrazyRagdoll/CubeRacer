Hello_World!

My name is Sam, and this is my game, it is a simple game made by a simple man. It does not require much smarts to play. 

Here are the keys:

Move Right - Right key.
Move Left  - Left key.
Fire       - Spacebar.
Exit       - Escape.

When adding music to the game I used: http://www.kekkai.org/roger/sdl/mixer/

The libaries that I have inclucded in my games are:
SDL2

Glew/glu

Vectormath

When editing cmake to allow it to find different libaries I had to use external sheets of code from different website: FindSDL2.cmake, FindGLEW.cmake, FindVECTORMATH.cmake.
These websites are where I found the .cmake files from:
